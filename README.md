## Atomic behaviours

### Does a row contain a certain number?
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] contains 1? -> true
[2,3,4,5,5,6,7,8,9] contains 1? -> false
[1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,9] contains 5? -> false

### Does a row contain all numbers 1-9?
- [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] -> true
- [1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] -> false
- [1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,9] -> false

### Does first column contains all numbers 1-9?
